
CommonSense 'Outside-the-Box' Design Studios Ltd. is happy to announce the latest design in 
software upgrades for use in all ranges of space vessels. SniperLock software allows for 
more accurate targetting by enabling longer dwell times on targets. The new control system 
will be in effect when the software upgrade known as "SniperLockv1.oxp" is placed in the 
space vessels' computer's AddOns folder. We hope you will find the 500 credit price to be a 
real bargain. Available at all shipyards tech level 12+. Thank you for your patronage. 

THIS OXP IS A PRODUCTION OF COMMONSENSE 'OUTSIDE-THE-BOX' DESIGN STUDIOS LTD.

USER CUSTOMIZABILITY:

For those with drifting joysticks, disabilities, unnaturally poor aim, and for other reasons, 
you now have the option of adjusting how accurate you have to aim to get a lock, how much 
force you have to apply to the controls to force an unlock, and how long the lock will last.
You may go to the startup function of the sniperlock script and set your own adjusted values.


COMPATIBILITY:
Oolite version 1.75.3 due to CTD frame callback issues in previous oolite versions.
Sniperlock software requires scanner targetting enhancement to be installed to operate.
Can be used with most heads-up-display systems.
Compatible with target tracker.
No dependancies.

SniperLockv1.oxp.

SniperLock software acts as an intermediary between you and your ship. When you have a great 
shot lined up on your currently selected target, the software temporarily takes micro-control 
over the ships attitude thrusters to keep the ship lined up on target. The override lasts for 
a fraction of a second and provided the pilot continues to aim, the software can then re-lock 
again and again. The pilot may override the lock-on by simply pushing slightly on the pitch 
or yaw controls. The best way to use this software upgrade is not to think about it. Fly and 
aim normally and the system will automatically micro-correct any minor misalignment in your 
aim. Fire a laser burst at the beginning of each lock-on for most effective results.
SniperLock software is not perfect and there may be a slight lag as the target is tracked. 
Sudden evasive movements and fuel injecting by the target may break the lock-on. Also, due to 
liability issues, the software will only initiate lock-on with targets over 5km distant to 
avoid the possibility of collisions.
SniperLock software and control interface works with most other targetting systems and 
heads-up-displays. Any odd behaviour should be reported to the software arm of 
CommonSense 'Outside-the-Box' Design Studios Ltd., of which SniperLock is a wholly owned 
subsidiary.

When you want to keep the bad guys out of arms reach, get SniperLock. Legal in all 8 sectors.


THANX AND RECOGNITION: Okti for the example of basic code to orient the ship contained in his
                       oxp target tracker. I learn best by seeing examples of code that works, 
					   many of which are already being used in my hud concepts. Much thanks.
					   THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND HELP!   -Sincerely, CommonSenseOTB.

ABOUT THIS PRODUCT: SniperLockv1.oxp requires oolite 1.75.3 or better. The frame callbacks used 
                    may occasionally cause a CTD when you die in versions of oolite earlier 
					than 1.75.3.					

TO USE THIS OXP: Unzip and drag or move the SniperLockv1.oxp folder into your addons folder.
